You have to write a python script that takes inputs ( name, email, mobile, university, major ) from user and save it in a python dictionary then generate a csv file with this data.
The user can put the data ( name, email, mobile, university, major ) many times and if the user type STOP the code will stop taking inputs from the user and starting producing the csv file
